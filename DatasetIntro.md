# Dataset Introduction

This dataset was constructed from ACL 2024 long papers, specifically designed to assess the figure generation capabilities of large language models. Our dataset contains aligned pairs of paper titles, abstracts, arXiv IDs, first figures, first figure captions and introduction extracted from the LaTeX source files of these academic papers.

We systematically collected the dataset through a multi-step process: (1) scraping paper titles from the ACL 2024 Anthology, (2) retrieving corresponding arXiv identifiers through relevance-based searches, (3) downloading and extracting LaTeX source files, and (4) parsing these files to extract abstracts, first figures,  first figure captions and introduction.
