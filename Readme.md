We introduce a new dataset consisting of information extracted from ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) 2024 long papers. The dataset contains paper titles, arXiv IDs, abstracts, first figures, and their corresponding captions.
We collected long paper titles from the ACL 2024 anthology and retrieved their arXiv identifiers through a relevance-based search. From these papers, we downloaded and processed the LaTeX source files to extract the abstract text, first figure images, and figure captions.
The dataset comprises successfully extracted information from 327 papers, providing a valuable resource for multimodal analysis of scientific papers, particularly focusing on the relationship between titles, abstracts, Fig 1 descriptions and Fig 1 itself in the computational linguistics domain.
